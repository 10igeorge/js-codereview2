# Meal Tracker

#### Created By
Isabelle George

## Description
This project was for a code review for the Epicodus JavaScript class implementing Angular2 and TypeScript. The goal of the project was to list meal entries as well as allowing the user to input their own entries. It also returns the total calories consumed, allows the user to edit entries, and requires the user to select a meal name to view more information such as calories and entry notes.

Enjoy!
